\introduction  %% \introduction[modified heading if necessary]
Chebyshev filters are analog or digital filters having a steeper roll-off and more passband ripple (type I) or stopband ripple (type II) than Butterworth filters. Chebyshev filters have the property that they minimize the error between the idealized and the actual filter characteristic over the range of the filter,[citation needed] but with ripples in the passband. This type of filter is named after Pafnuty Chebyshev because its mathematical characteristics are derived from Chebyshev polynomials.

Because of the passband ripple inherent in Chebyshev filters, the ones that have a smoother response in the passband but a more irregular response in the stopband are preferred for some applications.



\section{Type I Chebyshev filters}
Type I Chebyshev filters are the most common types of Chebyshev filters. The gain (or amplitude) response as a function of angular frequency $\omega$ of the nth-order low-pass filter is equal to the absolute value of the transfer function $H_n(j\omega)$:
$G_n(\omega)=\left | H_n(j \omega) \right | = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\varepsilon^2 T_n^2\left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_0}\right)}}$

where $\varepsilon$ is the ripple factor, $\omega_0$ is the cutoff frequency and $T_n$ is a Chebyshev polynomial of the $n$th order.

The passband exhibits equiripple behavior, with the ripple determined by the ripple factor $\varepsilon$. In the passband, the Chebyshev polynomial alternates between $ -1 $ and $ 1 $ so the filter gain alternate between maxima at $G = 1$ and minima at $G=1/\sqrt{1+\varepsilon^2}$. At the cutoff frequency $\omega_0$ the gain again has the value $1/\sqrt{1+\varepsilon^2}$ but continues to drop into the stop band as the frequency increases. This behavior is shown in the diagram on the right. The common practice of defining the cutoff frequency at $ -3 $ $dB$ is usually not applied to Chebyshev filters; instead the cutoff is taken as the point at which the gain falls to the value of the ripple for the final time.

The order of a Chebyshev filter is equal to the number of reactive components (for example, inductors) needed to realize the filter using analog electronics.

The ripple is often given in $dB$:

Ripple in $dB = 10 \log_{10}(1+\varepsilon^2)$
so that a ripple amplitude of 3 $dB$ results from $\varepsilon = 1$.

An even steeper roll-off can be obtained if ripple is allowed in the stop band, by allowing zeroes on the $j\omega$-axis in the complex plane. However, this results in less suppression in the stop band. The result is called an elliptic filter, also known as Cauer filter.

\subsection{Poles and zeroes}
For simplicity, it is assumed that the cutoff frequency is equal to unity. The poles ($\omega_{pm}$) of the gain function of the Chebyshev filter are the zeroes of the denominator of the gain function. Using the complex frequency s, these occur when:
$1+\varepsilon^2T_n^2(-js)=0.$
Defining $-js=\cos(\theta)$ and using the trigonometric definition of the Chebyshev polynomials yields:

$1+\varepsilon^2T_n^2(\cos(\theta))=1+\varepsilon^2\cos^2(n\theta)=0.$\,
Solving for $\theta$

$\theta=\frac{1}{n}\arccos\left(\frac{\pm j}{\varepsilon}\right)+\frac{m\pi}{n}$
where the multiple values of the arc cosine function are made explicit using the integer index $m$. The poles of the Chebyshev gain function are then:

$s_{pm}=j\cos(\theta)=j\cos\left(\frac{1}{n}\arccos\left(\frac{\pm j}{\varepsilon}\right)+\frac{m\pi}{n}\right).$
Using the properties of the trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, this may be written in explicitly complex form:

$s_{pm}^\pm=\pm \sinh\left(\frac{1}{n}\mathrm{arsinh}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)\right)\sin(\theta_m)+j  \cosh\left(\frac{1}{n}\mathrm{arsinh}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)\right)\cos(\theta_m)$
where $m = 1, 2,..., n$  and

$\theta_m=\frac{\pi}{2}\,\frac{2m-1}{n}$.
This may be viewed as an equation parametric in $\theta_n$ and it demonstrates that the poles lie on an ellipse in s-space centered at $s = 0$ with a real semi-axis of length $\sinh(\mathrm{arsinh}(1/\varepsilon)/n$) and an imaginary semi-axis of length of $\cosh(\mathrm{arsinh}(1/\varepsilon)/n)$
\subsection{The transfer function.}
The above expression yields the poles of the gain $G$. For each complex pole, there is another which is the complex conjugate, and for each conjugate pair there are two more that are the negatives of the pair. The transfer function must be stable, so that its poles are those of the gain that have negative real parts and therefore lie in the left half plane of complex frequency space. The transfer function is then given by

$H(s)= \frac{1}{2^{n-1}\varepsilon}\ \prod_{m=1}^{n} \frac{1}{(s-s_{pm}^-)}$
where $s_{pm}^-$ are only those poles with a negative sign in front of the real term in the above equation for the poles.
